# PIE_MAP
PIE_MAP is a map application written in C++ allowing users to view maps and search for intersections, parks, points of interests, and directions in 19 major cities around the world. Developed for tourists in mind, PIE_MAP offers a great user interface with impressive visuals and easy navigation. 

# Developers
PIE_MAP is co-developed by Raymond Yang (https://github.com/Electronic-Yoda), Stephen Wang (https://github.com/Stephenwang3801), and David Tran (https://github.com/davidtran001). 
It relies on the ezgl graphics library found here: https://github.com/mariobadr/ezgl, the GTK library, and data in OpenStreetMap. 

# NOTE:
Since some of the project are a part of the university's course work, most files in PIE_MAP are kept private on GitHub. This repository is meant to demonstrate PIE_MAP's functionality with gifs and photos. Additionally, it stores PIE_MAP's user interface and its relevant files, which are a deviation from the course and are meant to greatly expand PIE_MAP's user experience. Due to risks of Academic Offenses, the source code is not available on this public repository.

# Features in PIE-MAP
- Buttons that help the user interact by zooming in/out and panning
- Display Points of Interests (POIs) like restaurants and schools
- Display geography such as parks, rivers, lakes, streets, and buildings
- Clickable icons which can be toggled for more information
- Operational searchbar to find specific intersections and streets
- Labelled street and landmark names
- Navigation Algorithm (A* Graph Search Algorithm) which can find an optimal path between intersections
- Side bar with walking/driving instructions to follow the calculated route
- Clickable path finding by clicking on two intersections when search mode is toggled
